Understanding DevOps within the software development life cycle helps explain how planning, development, testing, and deployment are connected rather than treated as separate steps. Instead of waiting until the end of a project to test or deploy, DevOps encourages continuous feedback throughout the SDLC so issues are identified earlier. CI/CD practices support this approach by allowing small, incremental changes to move through the development cycle without disrupting the entire system.
