COMP 2156 explores how DevOps principles are applied within system administration and modern IT workflows. Instead of treating development and operations as separate responsibilities, the course focuses on how tools like Git, automation, and continuous integration support collaboration and reduce manual effort. By working with these concepts, students gain a clearer understanding of how structured workflows improve reliability and efficiency in real technical environments.
