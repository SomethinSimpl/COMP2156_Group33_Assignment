DevOps plays an important role in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). 
In traditional development models, developers and operations teams often worked separately, 
which sometimes caused delays or miscommunication.

DevOps helps bridge that gap by encouraging collaboration, automation, and continuous improvement. 
Using tools like Git and CI/CD pipelines allows teams to deploy updates more frequently and reliably.
