George Brown College focuses heavily on applied learning rather than purely theoretical instruction. Many of its technology programs emphasize labs, projects, and real-world tools that reflect how systems and software are used in industry. This approach helps students develop practical problem-solving skills and become comfortable working in collaborative, technical environments.
