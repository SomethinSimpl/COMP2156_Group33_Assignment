George Brown College emphasizes learning through hands-on work rather than focusing only on theory. Many technology programs encourage students to solve practical problems using tools and workflows similar to those found in real IT environments. This style of learning helps students become more comfortable working through technical challenges while collaborating with others in a structured, team-based setting.
