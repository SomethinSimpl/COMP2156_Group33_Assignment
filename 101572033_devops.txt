COMP 2156 – DevOps for System Administration is a course that introduces students 
to the practical side of version control and collaboration. Instead of just learning 
theory, we actually work with Git and GitHub to understand how teams manage code.

In this course, we learned how to create branches, make commits, resolve merge conflicts, 
and push changes to a remote repository. It shows how important communication 
and organization are when multiple people are working on the same project.

The course also introduces continuous integration tools like GitHub Actions, 
which help automate tasks and improve workflow efficiency.

Overall, this course gives students a better understanding of how development 
and operations work together in modern IT environments.
